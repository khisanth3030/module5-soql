# Developer Kickstart Module 5: Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)

This repository is part of the Developer Kickstart Module 5 curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. It's crafted to assist beginner Salesforce developers to learn and exercise Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL), a pivotal aspect of the Apex programming language.

## Goals of the Practice

In the course  of this practice repository, you'll build essential knowledge about:
- Understanding the fundamentals of SOQL and its significance in Apex and Salesforce development.
- Crafting basic SOQL queries using the SELECT statement to retrieve data from Salesforce objects.
- Employing WHERE clause filters in SOQL queries to refine the data retrieved based on specific conditions.
- Navigating relationship queries in SOQL to retrieve data from related Salesforce objects.
- Using the LIMIT keyword in SOQL queries to regulate the number of records retrieved.

By mastering SOQL, you will boost your ability to interact with Salesforce data programmatically, enabling you to build dynamic, data-driven applications on the Salesforce platform. These concepts lay the foundation for advanced data manipulation and handling techniques in Salesforce.
